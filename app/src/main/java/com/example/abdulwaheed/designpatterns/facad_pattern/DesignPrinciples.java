     * Definition
     * ==========
     * The Facade Pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces
     * in a sub system. Facade defines a higher level interface that makes sub system
     * easier to use.
     *
     * Who does What?
     * ==============
     * Decorator ==> Converts one interface to another
     * Adapter ==> Does not alter the interface, but adds responsibility
     * Facade ==> Makes an interface simpler
