     * Design Pattern Rules
     * ====================
     * 1) Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete class. This rule is called
     * Dependency Inversion Principle.
     *
     * 2) Both Abstract factory and Factory method encapsulate object creation and lead to more
     * decoupled flexible designs
     *
     *
     * Definition
     * ==========
     * The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide
     * which class to instantiate, Factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
